Hi it's secto_ssd 

Demographer by training, I started by doing statistics before becoming interested in my work in computer programming. This leads me gradually to data science. I started by offering learning solutions to my marketing company 
and then decided to embark on the adventure of freelancing last year. I first realized projects on the condingame platform to familiarize myself with the development and the python language. In the fall I passed the famous Ng 
Andrews certifications on machine learning and deeplearning to bring out my skills. Since then I do kaggle projects. After spending a lot of time to consider my skills I am now ready to take missions even if I still have a lot 
to learn on the side of data ingeeniring.

I live and grew up in the countryside and my strength is to have kept this "old world" taste of simplicity and work well done. By inclination I am also a man of science and I kept the taste of investigation and methodological 
requirement.  Outside work I take care of my vegetables and flowers or I read philosohie and history. I also spend a lot of time looking after the elderly at the retirement home in my village.

Ho! and I am French. If you know monthy python you will understand why I chose this character ...
